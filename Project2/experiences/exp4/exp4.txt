Q1: How to configure a static route in a commercial router?
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 172.16.1.254
ip route 172.16.y0.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.y1.253

Q2: What are the paths followed by the packets in the experiments carried out and why?
if there's a route from tux2 to tux1 through tux4, the route is tux2->tux4->tux1.
if there's no route from tux2 to tux1, the route is tux2->router->tux4->tux1.
if tux2 allows accepts redirects, the route is tux2->router->tux4->tux1 in the first time but then it's tux2->tux4->tux1

Q3: How to configure NAT in a commercial router?
conf t
interface gigabitethernet 0/0 *
ip address 172.16.y1.254 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
ip nat inside
exit

interface gigabitethernet 0/1*
ip address 172.16.1.y9 255.255.255.0
no shutdown
ip nat outside
exit

ip nat pool ovrld 172.16.1.y9 172.16.1.y9 prefix 24
ip nat inside source list 1 pool ovrld overload

access-list 1 permit 172.16.y0.0 0.0.0.7
access-list 1 permit 172.16.y1.0 0.0.0.7

Q4: What does NAT do?
Network Address Translation (NAT) is the process where a network device, usually a firewall,
assigns a public address to a computer (or group of computers) inside a private network.
The main use of NAT is to limit the number of public IP addresses an organization or company must use,
for both economy and security purposes.
