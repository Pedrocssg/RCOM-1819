Q1: What routes are there in the tuxes? What are their meaning?
tux1:
    Dest           Gateway          Genmask          Flags    Metric    Ref    Use IFace
    0.0.0.0        172.16.50.254    0.0.0.0          UG       0         0      0   eth0
    172.16.50.0    0.0.0.0          255.255.255.0    U        0         0      0   eth0
    172.16.51.0    172.16.50.254    255.255.255.0    UG       0         0      0   eth0
tux2:
    Dest           Gateway          Genmask          Flags    Metric    Ref    Use IFace
    0.0.0.0        172.16.51.253    0.0.0.0          UG       0         0      0   eth0
    172.16.50.0    172.16.51.253    255.255.255.0    UG       0         0      0   eth0
    172.16.51.0    0.0.0.0          255.255.255.0    U        0         0      0   eth0
tux4:
    Dest           Gateway          Genmask          Flags    Metric    Ref    Use IFace
    172.16.50.0    0.0.0.0          255.255.255.0    U        0         0      0   eth0
    172.16.51.0    0.0.0.0          255.255.255.0    U        0         0      0   eth1
It means that tux1 is connected to tux4 and tux4 is connected to tux2.
And because tux4 is a router, tux2 can communicate to tux1 through tux4.

Q2: What information does an entry of the forwarding table contain?
Destination: route destination
gateway: next stop on the router
netmask: used to determine network id from destination ip
flags: route information
metric: route cost
refs: refs number for the route
use: search counter
interface: network adapter responsible for the gateway

Q3: What ARP messages, and associated MAC addresses, are observed and why?
who has 172.16.50.1 tell 172.16.50.254
00:21:5a:5a:79:c0 (himself)
when he doesn't recognize an ip, he asks who it is.

Q4: What ICMP packets are observed and why?
request and reply

Q5: What are the IP and MAC addresses associated to ICMP packets and why?
